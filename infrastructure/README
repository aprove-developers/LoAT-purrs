Tools needed by PURRS (see detailed instructions):

autoconf 2.57

fi_lib++ 2.0
ginac 1.0.13     (use our ftp version!)
cgicc 3.2.1

============================================================================

More Detailed Installation Instructions:

  NOTE: it is assumed that you can install packages as root,
        that the prefix that you want to install to is "/usr/local"
        and that you download and build all of the packages
        in a directory called "your-path-to-download-dir".
        For CVS access, it is assumed that you have ssh installed
        into directory "your-path-to-ssh".

============================================================================

Setting up your environment variables (once for all):

If you use the Bash shell, add the following lines to file .bashrc into
your home directory:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/filib/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export CVS_RSH=your-path-to-ssh/ssh

After saving it, ensure you re-read the file by calling:
  source .bashrc

To ensure that your environment variables have been updated,
try echoing them:
  echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
should output something like
  /usr/local/lib:/usr/local/filib/lib
