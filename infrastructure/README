Tools needed by PURRS (see detailed instructions):

autoconf 2.59
automake 1.9.2 or higher
libtool 1.5.6 or higher
gcc 3.4.1 or higher
gmp 4.1.2 or higher
cln 1.1.8 or higher
ntl 5.3.2
ginac 1.2.4 or higher
cgicc 3.2.3
giac 0.4.0-ap3 (use our FTP version!)

Please note that, due to incompatible GCC and library versions, you
could experience problems in compiling some dependencies if you use
certain software versions. Upgrading to the latest stable release of the
libraries or to GCC 4.x is a safe bet in most cases.

For automatic configuration and installation of dependencies you can use
the "depinst" script that comes with PURRS.

============================================================================

More Detailed Installation Instructions:

  NOTE: it is assumed that you can install packages as root,
        that the prefix that you want to install to is "/usr/local"
        and that you download and build all of the packages
        in a directory called "your-path-to-download-dir".
	It is also assumed that you install the packages in the order
	shown before because there are dependencies among them.
        The installation notes below can refer to more recent versions
        than our minimum requirements, but will apply with minimal
        changes to all supported versions.

============================================================================

Setting up your environment variables (once for all):

If you use the Bash shell, add the following lines to file .bashrc into
your home directory (the latter is required only if you want to checkout
a CVS version of PURRS):

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export CVS_RSH=your-path-to-ssh/ssh

After saving it, ensure you re-read the file by calling:
  source .bashrc

To ensure that your environment variables have been updated,
try echoing them:
  echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
should output something like
  /usr/local/lib
