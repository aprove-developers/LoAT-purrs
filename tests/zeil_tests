% Tests for Zeilberger Algorithm.
%
% Lines beginning with % are comments and will be ignored unless they follow
% a summand.
%
% Every line contains the summand (hypergeometric term in both n and k) that
% will be summed for all integer values of k.
% The immediately following line must contain the expected result.
%
% Basic example.
binom(n,k)
2^n
%
% Classic Zeilberger example (A=B, 6.4.1)
binom(n,k)^2
(2*n)!/(n!)^2
% (That actually is binom(2*n, n) ).
%
% A=B, 6.4.2
% This one in known to give a completely incorrect result.
(-1)^k*binom(n,k)*binom(3+k,k)
3/(3+n)
%
% Dixon sum, 6.4.4. It works.
(-1)^k*binom(2*n,k)^3
(-1)^n*((3*n)!)/(n!)^3
