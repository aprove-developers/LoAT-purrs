% *** The following Expectations are not supported yet ***
% Each recurrence is marked with one or more characters
% whose meaning is as follows:
%
% y expected to be solved
%   v with a provably correct result
%   p with a provably correct result for another recurrence used to
%     solve *this.
%   w with a provably wrong result
%   d with a result whose correctness can neither be proved nor be disproved
% n expected not to be solved
% K unsolvable: expect the system to diagnose this
% k unsolvable: expect the system not to diagnose this
% I indeterminate: the recurrence has infinitely many solutions
% M malformed: expect the system to gracefully deal with it
% D domain error: the recurrence is not well-defined
% m malformed: expect the system to die badly
% u expected to find upper bound 
%   v with a provably correct result
%   w with a provably wrong result
%   d with a result whose correctness can neither be proved nor be disproved
% l expected to find lower bound
%   v with a provably correct result
%   w with a provably wrong result
%   d with a result whose correctness can neither be proved nor be disproved
% E explodes
% b triggers a bug in the solver
% X of mixed type
% B bizarre: even assuming it makes sense, we have no plans to deal with it
% * no expectations

% Each recurrence must be followed by a line starting with I that contains
% a (possibly empty) semicolon-separated list of initial conditions.

* x(5, {m, p, q}) = 2*x(5, {m, p-1, q})+q
I x(5, {m, 0, q}) = k

% Constant difference
* x(4, {l, m, n}) = 2 * x(4, {l-1, m, n-1}) + l - m
I x(4, {0, m, n}) = 3; x(4, {l, m, 0}) = 3

% Length
* x(1,{m}) = a+x(1,{m-1})
I x(1, {0}) = b

% Bounded queue
* x(20, {m,n}) = a+b+x(10, {m-1,1+n})
I x(20, {m,0}) = c
% Solution: (a+b)*x1+a+c
