% Each recurrence is marked with one or more characters
% whose meaning is as follows:
%
% y expected to be solved
%   v with a provably correct result
%   p with a provably correct result for another recurrence used to
%     solve *this.
%   w with a provably wrong result
%   d with a result whose correctness can neither be proved nor be disproved
% n expected not to be solved
% K unsolvable: expect the system to diagnose this
% k unsolvable: expect the system not to diagnose this
% I indeterminate: the recurrence has infinitely many solutions
% M malformed: expect the system to gracefully deal with it
% D domain error: the recurrence is not well-defined
% m malformed: expect the system to die badly
% u expected to find upper bound 
%   v with a provably correct result
%   w with a provably wrong result
%   d with a result whose correctness can neither be proved nor be disproved
% l expected to find lower bound
%   v with a provably correct result
%   w with a provably wrong result
%   d with a result whose correctness can neither be proved nor be disproved
% E explodes
% b triggers a bug in the solver
% X of mixed type
% B bizarre: even assuming it makes sense, we have no plans to deal with it
% * no expectations
