% Some comments: 
%
% Polynomials of special shape such as $x^n\pm a$ should be treated directly,
% since they can be easily split as a product of polynomials of lower degree.
% Other special polynomials are $ax^{2n}+bx^n+c$ and indeed any polynomial
% of the form $p(x^a)$ where $p$ is a polynomail and $a\ge2$
% is some fixed integer.
