  Abstract = "An interactive computer program which has some capability
              for solving systems of finite difference equations
              is described.  Although this capability is limited to
              linear systems, a knowledgeable user can, with the help
              of the program, solve a wider class of equations.
              Over 100 examples, covering a variety of cases,
              have been solved by using the program.
              Some representative examples are presented.
              Additional features which would improve the versatility
              of the program are also discussed."

  Abstract = "A set of programs to find closed-form solutions to
              recurrence relations is described.  These programs
              are written in the MACSYMA programming language,
              a LISP-based system implemented at the Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology on the PDP-10 mc computer.
              Single variable recurrence relations with constant
              coefficients are solved as well as some variable
              coefficient recurrences.  The use of these programs
              is illustrated with several examples taken from textbooks.",
