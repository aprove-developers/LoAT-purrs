  Abstract = "An interactive computer program which has some capability
              for solving systems of finite difference equations
              is described.  Although this capability is limited to
              linear systems, a knowledgeable user can, with the help
              of the program, solve a wider class of equations.
              Over 100 examples, covering a variety of cases,
              have been solved by using the program.
              Some representative examples are presented.
              Additional features which would improve the versatility
              of the program are also discussed."
