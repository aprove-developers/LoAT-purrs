Please report bugs to the purrs-devel mailing list (see
http://www.cs.unipr.it/purrs/ for details); provide a short description and
a step-by-step way to reproduce the bug.

Known bugs are listed below.

Bug #1
Title: 		Cannot solve x^n-1=0
Description:	eqs_driver can easily solve x^n-K=0 for all values of K but 1.
Status:		RESOLVED UNVERIFIED
Priority:	High
Reproducible:	Always
Steps to reproduce:
  1. run eqs_driver -i
  2. type "x^5-3"
  3. type "x^5-1"
  4. Note that the second solution is unexpectedly cumbersome
  5. Same with x^7-3, x^7-1
  6. Solving x^7-1=0 is "Too difficult"... but x^7-3=0 is fine.

    Seems to apply only for N>=5, K=+1 or K=-1.

    It happens whenever the real root can be easily calculated. Try x^5-32.

    Any time a rational solution is found, a division is always carried out.

    RESOLVED: polynomials in the form x^n=k are now recognized and solved.

Bug #2
Title:		Correct but inconsistent solutions
Description:	Two correct but syntactically different solutions to same rec.
Status:		New
Priority:	Low (but worth investigating)
Reproducible:	Machine-dependent?
Steps to reproduce:
  1. Run rrs_driver -i
  2. Solve x(n)=x(n-1)+x(n-2)
  3. Solve it again (cursor up + enter)
  4. While being actually the same, the two solutions look different. Why?

    Feel like scripting? echo -e "x(n-1)+x(n-2)\nx(n-1)+x(n-2)"|rrs_driver -i

    Tried on two quite different machines and got the same behaviour.
