Please report bugs to the purrs-devel mailing list (see
http://www.cs.unipr.it/purrs/ for details); provide a short description and
a step-by-step way to reproduce the bug.

Known bugs are listed below.

Bug #1
Title: 		Cannot solve x^n-1=0
Description:	eqs_driver can easily solve x^n-K=0 for all values of K but 1.
Status:		RESOLVED UNVERIFIED
Priority:	High
Reproducible:	Always
Steps to reproduce:
  1. run eqs_driver -i
  2. type "x^5-3"
  3. type "x^5-1"
  4. Note that the second solution is unexpectedly cumbersome
  5. Same with x^7-3, x^7-1
  6. Solving x^7-1=0 is "Too difficult"... but x^7-3=0 is fine.

    Seems to apply only for N>=5, K=+1 or K=-1.

    It happens whenever the real root can be easily calculated. Try x^5-32.
  2004-04-15 pescetti
    Any time a rational solution is found, a division is always carried out.
  2004-04-15 pescetti
    RESOLVED: polynomials in the form x^n=k are now recognized and solved.

Bug #2
Title:		Correct but inconsistent solutions
Description:	Two correct but syntactically different solutions to same rec.
Status:		ASSIGNED (pescetti)
Priority:	High ([work on] Bug#3 depends on this)
Reproducible:	Always?
Steps to reproduce:
  1. Run rrs_driver -i
  2. Solve x(n)=x(n-1)+x(n-2)
  3. Solve it again (Cursor up + Enter)
  4. While being actually the same, the two solutions look different. Why?

    Feel like scripting? echo -e "x(n-1)+x(n-2)\nx(n-1)+x(n-2)"|rrs_driver -i

    Tried on two quite different machines and got the same behaviour.

    Since simplifying seems unreliable at times, this bug must be solved first.

Bug #3
Title:		INCONCLUSIVE_VERIFICATION after a few attempts
Description:	Solve and verify the same recurrence 4 times; 4th attempt fails
Status:		DEPENDS on Bug#2
Priority:	High
Reproducible:	Always?
Steps to reproduce:
  1. create 'heap.bug3': 4 identical lines, 'yv  ((n+1)*x(n-1)+(2*n-2))/n'
  2. run rrs_driver -rv < heap.bug3
  3. The recurrence is correctly solved (and solution verified) 3 times
  4. On the fourth attempt, verification fails: INCONCLUSIVE_VERIFICATION

    Bug#2 might depend on this one (or be the same problem in harmless form).

    Tried on two quite different machines and got the same behaviour.
  2004-05-24 pescetti
    Different expressions are passed to verify_exact_solution().
  2004-06-04 pescetti
    Actually, Bug#2 might *cause* this one: are we just unable to simplify?
  2004-06-05 pescetti
    Yep. We fail to simplify to zero a simple expression involving sums.
  2004-06-06 pescetti
    Further investigation on this bug depends on Bug#2.

Bug #4
Title:		Better simplification for sums needed
Description:	Simple sums aren't always correctly simplified to zero.
Status:		ASSIGNED (pescetti)
Priority:	Medium
Reproducible:	Always
Steps to reproduce:
  1. Run simplify_driver -i
  2. sum(a,1,n,a)+sum(a,1,n,-a) is correctly simplified to zero
  3. sum(a,1,n,a+1)+sum(a,1,n,-a-1) is not

    We should maybe collect the sum operator to get better solutions.
