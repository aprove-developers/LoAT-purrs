Bug #1
Title: 		Cannot solve x^n-1=0
Description:	eqs_driver can easily solve x^n-K=0 for all values of K but 1.
Status:		SOLVED UNVERIFIED
Priority:	High
Reproducible:	Always
Steps to reproduce:
  1. run eqs_driver -i
  2. type "x^5-3"
  3. type "x^5-1"
  4. Note that the second solution is unexpectedly cumbersome
  5. Same with x^7-3, x^7-1
  6. Solving x^7-1=0 is "Too difficult"... but x^7-3=0 is fine.

    Seems to apply only for N>=5, K=+1 or K=-1.

    It happens whenever the real root can be easily calculated. Try x^5-32.

    Any time a rational solution is found, a division is always carried out.

    SOLVED: polynomials in the form x^n=k are now recognized and solved.
