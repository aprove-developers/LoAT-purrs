Please refer to infrastructure/README for installation instructions.

Additional hints:
  - The installation instructions refer to very old libraries.
    This patched version of PURRS is known to work with more recent libraries:
    ginac 1.6.6, cln 1.3.4, giac 1.2.0, cgicc 3.2.3, gf2x 1.1 and ntl 9.6.2

  - Some versions of giac (e.g. the one listed above) have a bug in their include files,
    where one has to uncomment a line, as the name "ctrl_c" is undefined.
